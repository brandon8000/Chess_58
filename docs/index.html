	<h3>Just Another Chess App!</h3>
	<hr>
	<h2 id="about">What This Is</h2>
	<p>My final project for my Software Methodology class (basically Intro to Software Engineering). The goal was to build upon an earlier project to implement a full Android application.</p>
	<h2 id="examples">Features:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>All rules implemented (except <em>en passant</em>)</li>
		<li>Keeps a record of your moves and prints them at the end</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="download">Download</h2>
	<p>Make sure that you enable apps to be installed from unknown sources. A  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Install-APK" download>quick guide</a>.<br>Open this website on your phone and click <a href="./chess58.apk" download>here</a> to download. You should be prompted to install the application.</p>
	<h2 id="download">Stretch Goals</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Save and reload games that are in progress</li>
		<li>Save completed games in a format so that they can be viewed later</li>
		<li>Add some artificial intelligence the player can play against</li>
	</ul>
